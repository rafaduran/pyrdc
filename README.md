# README

This tiny project is a mix of code snippets than either I've found on the 
Internet or I've written myself:

* If you like it fork me!

* If you send a pull request!

# Install
You need setuptools in order to install it:
    $ python setup.py install

# DOCS

You can get further information about all code snippets checking docs:

    $ cd docs
    $ make html
